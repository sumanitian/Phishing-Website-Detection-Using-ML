                        An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device, or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any intrusion activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs 
                        from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms
                        </br> 
                        The majority of intrusion prevention systems utilize one of three detection methods: signature-based, statistical anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis.

                        Signature-based detection: Signature-based IDS monitors packets in the Network and compares with pre-configured and pre-determined attack patterns known as signatures.
                        Statistical anomaly-based detection: An IDS which is anomaly-based will monitor network traffic and compare it against an established baseline. The baseline will identify what is "normal" for that network â€“ what sort of bandwidth is generally used and what protocols are used. It may however, raise a False Positive alarm for legitimate use of bandwidth if the baselines are not intelligently configured.
                        Stateful protocol analysis detection: This method identifies deviations of protocol states by comparing observed events with "pre-determined profiles of generally accepted definitions of benign activity"

                            Blocking malicious URLs:
                        </br>
                            There are several engines and ways to block malicious URLs. In the case of email networks, for example, you can get a Secure Email Gateway. In the case of browsers, you can install protection plugins.
                            The most effective and common protection techniques are based on filters that use URL blacklists, comparing domains and hosts. Other techniques involve machine learning, URL rewriting, Sandboxing and real-time click detection.</br></br></p>
